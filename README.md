Abstract

This project deals with various visualization techniques applied to a dataset, to make it easy to draw conclusions about the data by looking at the plot.
The raw data set is very difficult to understand and analyze to get to a conclusion by looking at the datasets. Finding the right data for showing the required output is also important for this project. The challenging part in this project is the cleaning process involved with the raw data. Because a cleaned data is key for effective data analysis. According to my analysis cancer has always been the leading cause of death from 2005 through 2015. Deaths due to heart diseases decreased from 2005 to 2010 but has again increased from 2010 to 2015. When I have done more deep analysis by partitioning the data according to the ages I found an interesting trend which is also good news that for the population below the age 50, the cases of heart disease deaths have decreased from 2005 to 2015. Which means that younger population is more more health conscious and may be also due to improvement in health care and medical services in the country.
